**Trustified Finance** is a cross-chain escrow platform that enables secure marketplace transactions by leveraging dual staking. Users first stake assets on Babylon to earn rewards and build liquidity, then re-stake these assets in escrow contracts to secure deals. This approach boosts trust, maximizes staking rewards, and facilitates seamless, secure transactions across chains.

**Trustified Finance Process Overview**

1. Asset Staking: A user stakes their assets (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) on Babylon to start earning rewards.
